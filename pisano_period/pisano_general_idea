Pisano period is a period with which the sequence of Fibonacci number taken "modulo n" repeats.
let's consider a Fibonacci series.
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233..
now take modulo 3, we get
0,1,1,2,0,2,2,1,0,1,1,2,0,2,2,1,0,1,1,2..
thus we got our repeating digits... i.e. 0,1,1,2,0,2,2,1
thus the sequence has a period of "8"
